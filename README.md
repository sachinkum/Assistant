# Assistant
Project Aim - Build a virtual assistant for Ubuntu

Current Capabilities - Chatbot with speech recognition and text-to-speech output. Uses the google-text-to-speech api for the same. Currently working on Python 2.7

Features to be added -                            
  Port to Python 3 (critical).                                                 
  Add minor system commands to vocabulary so as to perform non-critical functions through the assistant. No rm-rf!!       
  Add self learning capabilities and user personalisation.                                               
  Add a visual output when the bot speaks. Preferrrably something similar to Cortana(from Halo).

Issues -                              
  Can't find a reliable AIML 2 library for Python 3. Everything is currently on hold.
